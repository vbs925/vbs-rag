Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. 
It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python's extensive standard library and simple syntax make it a popular choice for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.
